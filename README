Usage:
    brocket [-hHLv] [-m|n][-a|p|R][-c] COMMAND [TITLE]

    brocket attempts to see if an application is running, and if so, bring the
     application's window to the front, otherwise launch an instance.
     In essence, a single window moveMode.

Arguments:
    TITLE     The window title to search for.(case insensitive substring)
    COMMAND   The shell command to search the window classes with.

              A title search is optional and the command will be used instead.
              A command search should be sufficient to find a general program.
              Multiple results will be cycled through.

Modes:
    -a   Move to the desktop with the window.
    -p   Only activate windows on the current desktop. (default)
    -R   Bring the window from any desktop.

    -c   Ignore the window class and only do a window title search.
    -m   Move the active window to the desktop on the left.  (ignores searches)
    -n   Move the active window to the desktop on the right. (ignores searches)

Help:
    -h   Print help.
    -H   Print more help.
    -L   GPL License.
    -v   Be verbose.

Examples:
    brocket kate
    brocket Dolphin dolphin
    brocket "LibreOffice Writer" libreoffice
    brocket -R amarok
    brocket -Rv konsole
    brocket -ac gwenview
    brocket -m
    
Compatability:
    - brocket is based on wmctrl, and should work with the same WMs as wmctrl.
    - wmctrl is compatible with 'EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Managers'
       Explicitly: Enlightenment, IceWM, KWin, Sawfish, and Xfce.
       Implicitly: Awesome, Fluxbox, Compiz, Openbox, and Metacity
                   (and XMonad if you turn on EWHM), and probably others.
    - With all that being said, brocket has only been developed for/on Kwin.

Peculiarities:
    - The trumping order of modes is [-m|n][-a|p|R]

Suggestions:
    - Try out KDE4's Custom Shortcuts to create a global shortcut.
    - Try aliases in ~/.bashrc. This will only affect your terminals, and not
       krunner or KDE4's global shortcuts. Run multiple instances by \escaping.

Future Plans:
    - Close window after inactivity time which is not possible in wmctrl.
    - Be able to -aR from specific desktops. (like a -p 1 option)
    - Be able to launch onto specific desktops.wmctrl
    - Raise to specific screens
