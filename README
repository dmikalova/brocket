#Information:
    brocket v1.0 by superfuzzykittens
    https://github.com/superfuzzykittens/brocket

# Help
help="Usage: brocket [-hv[a|p|R]] [TITLE] COMMAND

brocket attempts to see if an application is running, and if so, bring the
 application's window to the front, otherwise launch an instance.
 In essence, a single window mode.

Help:
    -h   Print this help.
    -H   Print some more information.
    -v   Be verbose.

Arguments:
    TITLE     The window title case insensitive substring to search for.
    COMMAND   The shell command to run if there are no matches.

              A title search argument is optional, and when not provided, the
               command will be searched.

Modes:
    -a   Go to the desktop with the window.
    -p   Only activate windows on this desktop.
    -R   Bring the window from another desktop.

Examples:
    brocket kate
    brocket Dolphin dolphin
    brocket "LibreOffice Writer" libreoffice
    brocket -R amarok
    brocket -pv konsole

Peculiarities:
    - The last mode entered is the one that counts.
    - p trumps a|R.
    - If there are multiple search results, the oldest one counts.

Suggestions:
    - Try aliases in ~/.bashrc, however you won't be able to launch multiple
       instances without \escaping.
    - Also try out KDE4's Custom Shortcuts to create a global shortcut.

Future Plans:
    - Implement move window to desktop +-1 (missing in KDE4)
    - Close window after inactivity time (not possible in wmctrl)
